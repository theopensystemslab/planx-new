            | 1         | Demo          | User      | demo.user@email.com   |
            | 2         | Nota          | Demo      | nota.demo@email.com   |

        And I have the following flows in the database:
            | creator_id | name             | slug              | team_id |
            | 1          | Demo Flow        | demo-flow         | 32      |
