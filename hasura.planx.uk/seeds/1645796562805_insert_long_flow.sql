These are:\n\n- [section 171B(4)(b) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/section/171B), which provides for the taking of further enforcement action in respect of any breach of planning control within 4 years of previous enforcement action (or purported action) in respect of the same breach. This mainly deals with the situation where earlier enforcement action has been taken, within the relevant time-limit, but has later proved to be defective, so that a further notice may be issued or served, as the case may be, even though the normal time-limit for such action has since expired. This is known as the second bite provision\n- where there has been deliberate concealment of a breach of planning control, local planning authorities may apply for a [planning enforcement order](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ensuring-effective-enforcement#Planning-Enforcement-Order) to allow them to take action after the time limits in section 171B have expired\n- where a person has deliberately concealed a breach of planning control, the courts have found that in these circumstances, the time limits in section 171B do not engage until the breach has been discovered (see Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government and another v Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council and Bonsall / Jackson v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government).\n\nTherefore, in cases of deliberate concealment, a local planning authority may decide to serve an enforcement notice out of time or apply for a planning enforcement order. It is for the local planning authority to decide which approach is appropriate in each case.\n","text":"Notes"},"type":100}}',1,NULL);

The Town and Country Planning Act 1990 55 (3) (a) later goes on to make an exception when it comes to dwellinghouses: \"For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that for the purposes of this section the use as two or more separate dwellinghouses of any building previously used as a single dwellinghouse involves a material change in the use of the building and of each part of it which is so used\".</p>\n<p>It thus follows, in some people''s view, that changing the use of PART of a non-dwellinghouse property (i.e. subdividing it), as long as that use falls within the same use category does not constitute development. Subsequently, this subdivided unit can have its use change again via any change of use permitted development.</p>\n<p>For others, however, 55 (2) (f) may not necessarily apply to subdivision of a planning unit as such, although it certainly covers any change of use within the same use class. So for example, change of use from a butchers shop to use as a post office (both within Use Class A1) is not to be taken for the purposes of the Act to involve development of the land. But subdivision or amalgamation of planning units may nonetheless amount to a material change of use if it has the effect of changing the character of the use. The Court of Appeals judgment in Wakelin is one example, and the more recent High Court judgment in Richmond upon Thames LBC v SSETR [2001] J.P.L. 84 (involving the amalgamation of seven dwellings so as to re-convert the building to use as a single dwelling) is another example, where the change in the size of the planning unit was held to affect the character of the use in planning terms (in a broad sense, not confined to its possible environmental effects) and was thus a material change of use amounting to development, notwithstanding the fact that the earlier and later uses were all within one and the same use class.</p>\n<p>This may come as a surprise to many people, as there seems to be a general assumption that section 55(2)(f) covers subdivision of a planning unit, so long as the use of all of the new planning units created by this subdivision remains within one and the same use class. Richmond clearly established that this is not necessarily so with regard to the amalgamation of two or more planning units, but it seems that the same could equally apply to the sub-division of a planning unit. A material change of use does not necessarily occur upon the sub-division of a planning unit, but if this changes the character of the use (in planning terms) then this may amount to a material change of use, notwithstanding section 55(2)(f).</p>\n<p>It is quite frankly a grey area. It will be a matter of fact and degree, dependent of the precise circumstances of each such change to the planning unit.</p>","policyRef":"<p><a

The real question is whether a separate dwellinghouse and a new planning unit would be formed. The judgment in Uttlesford DC v SOS and White, 1991 holds that there was no reason in law why a granny annex with all the facilities for day-to-day living would automatically become a separate planning unit.\nThere are circumstances where the proposal for conversion is motivated by an older generation wishing to downsize, rather than to meet any current healthcare needs. The old generation may be more than likely to live independently of those in the ''main house'', which would go against the general view of what a granny annex normally constituted. However, if a ''separate planning unit'' would not be formed, there is a sufficently intimate physical relationship between the dwelling and the annex, a lack of any physical subdivision of the garden, driveway or parking areas, no separate address would be created such that utilities would be billed as a single property, in some judges view this meets the base critera of being a granny annex. Use as a granny annex does not certify that the use of the property would be lawful if used in a different manner from that put forward or if circumstances were to change in future.","policyRef":"[Town and Country Planning Act 1990, Section 55](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/section/55)","text":"The annexe will be occupied by"},"edges":["EtpujxESQe","qFr2pNMYK1","dbRCDzExjW","sNNL0EBc2Q","55RXVYbQ1V"],"type":100},"RIlfJFBvJS":{"data":{"text":"Restaurant or cafe","val":"commercial.retail.restaurant"},"edges":["QGbTxfHGcx"],"type":200},"wDtGfRLrml":{"data":{"text":"You cant do Class E > Flat > betting shop etc"},"type":100},"9zYKliCNaO":{"data":{"definitionImg":"https://user-data-8038f15.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ualdzl7f/extension_stepped.svg","howMeasured":"<p>The depth of an extension is measured from the external face of the rear wall of the ''Original'' house.

He observed that from public vantage points the site had the appearance of an undeveloped, overgrown plot of land.  I contend that the existence of walls up to 2.5m cannot have blended into the landscape in the words of PPS3. Lack of visibility from outside the site was due to an overgrown laurel hedge.
