## What are local planning services?
Local planning services are smart digital tools that help homeowners, businesses and planning experts navigate the planning process, from checking if they need planning permission to submitting a full application. 

Built by local planning authorities and planning professionals, these services replace complex and cumbersome forms with simple digital journeys, making planning faster, more transparent, cheaper and easier to get right the first time.
