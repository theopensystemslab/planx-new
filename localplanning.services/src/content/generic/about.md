## What are local planning services?
You can now access a variety of digital planning services to notify, report, and submit a planning application directly to your local planning authority, along with guidance to help you navigate the planning process.

Built by your local planning team in collaboration with planning professionals, these digital services replace complex and cumbersome forms with simple digital journeys to make planning faster, simpler, cheaper and easier to get right the first time.
