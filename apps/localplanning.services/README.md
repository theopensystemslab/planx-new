## 🤖 Build / CI

### Deployment Pipeline

LocalPlanning.services is built and deployed automatically via GitHub Actions -

**Staging**: Triggered on push to `main` branch

- Domain: `https://localplanning.editor.planx.dev`
- Workflow: `.github/workflows/push-main.yml`

**Production**: Triggered on push to `production` branch

- Domain: `https://localplanning.services`
- Workflow: `.github/workflows/push-production.yml`

### Static site generation

The site is pre-rendered at build time using Astro's static generation (SSG) -

1. **Build command**: `pnpm build --site <domain> --mode <staging|production>`
2. **Data fetching**: Pages query the PlanX API during build to fetch team and service data
3. **Output**: Static HTML, CSS, and JS files in `./dist/`
4. **Infrastructure**: Files are uploaded to S3 and served via CloudFront CDN with extensionless URLs (e.g., `/about` instead of `/about.html`)

**Important**: Content is only updated when the site is rebuilt and redeployed. Changes to team data, applications, or configurations in the PlanX database will not appear on LocalPlanning.services until the next deployment to `main` or `production`.

### Infrastructure

Deployment is managed by Pulumi (`infrastructure/application/services/lps.ts`):

- **S3 Bucket**: Stores built static files
- **CloudFront Distribution**: CDN with custom domain, SSL certificates (ACM), and Origin Access Identity for secure S3 access
- **DNS**: Cloudflare CNAME records pointing to CloudFront
