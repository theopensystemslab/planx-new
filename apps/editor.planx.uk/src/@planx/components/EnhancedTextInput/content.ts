  We use AI to review your project description and suggest improvements that may help your planning application be accepted more quickly.

  The AI checks your description for - 
  - Clear explanations of what you want to build
  - Relevant details that planning officers need
  - Appropriate language and structure

  You'll always see both your original description and the AI suggestion. You can choose which one to use, or write your own.

  ## Our AI principles

  **You're in control** - You decide whether to use the AI suggestion or stick with your own description.

  **Your data is protected** - We only use your description to generate suggestions. We don't share it with third parties.

  **Not a replacement** - The AI is a helpful tool, but your application will still be reviewed by real planning officers who make the final decision.
