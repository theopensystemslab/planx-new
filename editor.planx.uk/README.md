# editor.planx.uk

Editor is our React frontend, which consists of two main environments: an "editor" for service designers and a "preview" for public applicants. Our components are written with Material UI and broadly follow the [GOV.UK design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) patterns. 

## Running locally

### Disabling type-checking

If your IDE does type checking for you and you want to save some CPU resources,
you can opt-out of type checking by setting the environment variable
`DISABLE_TYPE_CHECKING=true`.

We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for our UI component library.
