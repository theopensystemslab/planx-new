      "Plan✕ is designed to be used by as many people as possible. You should be able to:\n\n- zoom in text up to 300% without problems\n- view most content in sufficient contrast\n- understand the meaning of questions even if you are unable to view any illustrations clearly\n\nHowever, because Plan✕ supports planning services,  this may involve some unusual or legacy information formats that may be difficult for some people to use (such as maps and PDF drawings). We are grateful for any feedback or suggestions for ways we can make any part of the platform easier to use.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n## Parts of the service that will not be fully accessible while Plan✕ is still in development \n\nSome parts of services on Plan✕ are not yet fully accessible. For example:\n\n- You cannot yet fully navigate the service using just a keyboard\n- You cannot yet navigate the service using speech recognition software\n- You may encounter significant issues when using a screenreader\n- Some smaller buttons or pieces of text have poor contrast or visibilityMaps cannot zoom, pan and view in full screen\n- The ‘draw boundary on a map feature’ is difficult to use, especially on mobile devices\n- Some text may not be written in plain english due to the need to include terms from planning law\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n## Reporting accessibility problems with Plan✕\nTo report an accessibility issue with Plan✕ please use the in-service feedback feature or email us at [enquiries@planx.uk](mailto:enquiries@planx.uk)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n## Compliance status\nPlan✕ is not yet fully compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) version 2.1 AA standard, as it is still in development.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n## What we’re doing to improve accessibility\n\nWe’re currently working on improvements that will significantly increase accessibility before going to Public BETA. We will update this page when those changes are live.\n\n`Version 0.1 / Last updated July 2021`\n\n\n\n# \n",
