/**
 * PlanningConstraints fetches data about constraints from DLUHC's planning.data.gov.uk & data about classified roads from the Ordnance Survey Features API.
 *
 * We do a spatial query to find constraints that overlap with the red-line site boundary polygon drawn using DrawBoundary.
 * If an applicant uploads a PDF location plan or skips drawing, then we fallback to checking for constraints that intersect with the address point selected using FindProperty.
 *
 * Example sites:
 * - "With Intersections" is based on a site boundary around LAMBETH PALACE, LAMBETH PALACE ROAD, LONDON, SE1 7JU in July 2023
 * - "Without Intersections" is based on a site boundary around 2, WALLER ROAD, BEACONSFIELD, BUCKINGHAMSHIRE, HP9 2HE in July 2023
