/**
 * Default DrawBoundary content
 *   This isn't an ideal way to store or edit HTML. A nicer way to generate and update the content of this file is to:
 *     1. Update one DrawBoundary node directly in the editor using the RichText inputs, make note of its node ID in the URL
 *     2. In the console, run `copy(window.api.getState().flow["{your node id}"].data)`
 *     3. Paste formatted content here. Now all new DrawBoundary nodes will reflect this content
 *     4. (Optional) Run migration script to bulk update existing DrawBoundary nodes across all applicable flows
