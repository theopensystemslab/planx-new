// XXX: Why does `isPreviewOnlyDomain` contain hard-coded values?
//
//      Ideally, we'd want to get rid of these hard-coded domain names in favour of inferring them by calling getTeamFromDomain.
//      Here's some pseudo-code:
//
//          const isPreviewOnlyDomain = Boolean(await getTeamFromDomain(window.location.hostname))
//
//      Unfortunately, it's not that easy. The `isPreviewOnlyDomain` variable is easy to inject, and access from context (or even from global variable) for all of the code but the `store`. The `store` is initialized as soon as the application comes up and depends on `isPreviewOnlyDomain` to be created. There are a couple of solutions I could think of, but they are either too much of a workaround or require too much refactoring:
//      1. Lazy initialisation of the variables, using async to get the team, and then setting the exported values based on the result. The problem here is the bad practice of exporting a mutable `let` variable.
//      2. Using `zustand`'s [Context](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand#react-context). We could initialize the store inside a component and take advantage of a `useEffect`, populate the store, and then render the `Provider` as soon as the store was ready. I tried doing this, but the `useStore` exported from `createContext` is a hook, and cannot be used outside React, therefore, we would have to refactor all functions that use `useStore.getState` to receive it as a prop, instead of accessing it directly.
//      3. Since the store is loaded only once and right after the application is up, even if we used a global variable it would not be initialized yet.
//
//      So I've hard-coded these domain names until a better solution comes along.
