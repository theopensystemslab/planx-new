# How to add `ALLOW_LIST` variables for analytics

## Context

For PlanX, we are using a platform called Metabase to handle analytics for how people use the services from different local authorities. In order to tell Metabase what to pick up, we allow a number of variables to be exposed, these are contained in an array called `ALLOW_LIST`. You can see these in the database as columns in the views `analytics_summary` and `submission_services_summary`.

In these docs I will run through the steps for adding a new variable to `ALLOW_LIST` both in the codebase and in Hasura.

> [!WARNING] 
> Only passport variables that store non-personally-identifiable values should be added to the allow list. Sensitive or personally-identifiable data should **never** be tracked or exposed via analytics.

## Process

### Step 1 - Add variables to `ALLOW_LIST` array

 You will need to add the desired variables to two places in the codebase
  `api.planx.uk/modules/webhooks/service/analyzeSessions/operations.ts` and `editor.planx.uk/src/pages/FlowEditor/lib/analytics/provider.tsx`.

  Each file should have an array looking like the below:

    ```ts
    export const ALLOW_LIST = [
      "application.declaration.connection",
      "application.information.harmful",
      "application.information.sensitive",
      "application.type",
    ...
      "service.type",
      "usedFOIYNPP",
      "user.role",
      *your variable*,
    ] as const;
    ```

  Add your variable to this array.

  With both arrays now populated with the new variable we can now add them to our database views in Hasura

  >[!NOTE]
  > Variables should be added in alphabetical order and relate to a passport variable

### Step 2 - Adding variables to Hasura Views

  For this part, you will need to pull the variable out of the passport jsonb in the SQL script and put them into two database views,`analytics_summary` and `submission_services_summary`. Examples can be found already in the current view script for how to do this.

  Example to look for:

```sql
  /* Example from submission_services_summary */
  (((ls.allow_list_answers -> 'your.variable'::text) -> 0))::text AS your_variable_column_name

  /*Example from analytics_summary */
  (((al.allow_list_answers -> 'your.variable'::text) -> 0))::text AS your_variable_column_name
```

  Example of how a view may look:

```sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW "public"."submission_services_summary" AS 
  WITH resumes_per_session AS
  /* deleted the code here for readability */
  SELECT (ls.id)::text AS session_id,
      t.slug AS team_slug,
      f.slug AS service_slug,
      ls.created_at,
      ls.submitted_at,
      ((ls.submitted_at)::date - (ls.created_at)::date) AS session_length_days,
      ls.has_user_saved AS user_clicked_save,
      rps.number_times_resumed,
      ls.allow_list_answers,
      ((ls.allow_list_answers -> 'proposal.projectType'::text))::text AS proposal_project_type,
      ((ls.allow_list_answers -> 'application.declaration.connection'::text))::text AS application_declaration_connection,
      ((ls.allow_list_answers -> 'property.type'::text))::text AS property_type,
      ((ls.allow_list_answers -> 'drawBoundary.action'::text))::text AS draw_boundary_action,
      ((ls.allow_list_answers -> 'user.role'::text))::text AS user_role,
      ((ls.allow_list_answers -> 'property.constraints.planning'::text))::text AS property_constraints_planning,
      /* deleted the code here for readability */
      sa.s3_applications,
      ((ls.allow_list_answers -> 'usedFOIYNPP'::text))::text AS used_foiynpp,
      ((ls.allow_list_answers -> 'propertyInformation.action'::text))::text AS property_information_action,
      ((ls.allow_list_answers -> 'planningConstraints.action'::text))::text AS planning_constraints_action,
      ((ls.allow_list_answers -> '_overrides'::text))::text AS overrides,
      ((ls.allow_list_answers -> 'rab.exitReason'::text))::text AS rab_exit_reason,
      ((ls.allow_list_answers -> 'service.type'::text))::text AS pre_app_service_type,
      ((ls.allow_list_answers -> 'application.information.harmful'::text))::text AS pre_app_harmful_info,
      ((ls.allow_list_answers -> 'application.information.sensitive'::text))::text AS pre_app_sensitive_info,
      (((ls.allow_list_answers -> 'application.type'::text) -> 0))::text AS application_type
    FROM lowcal_sessions ls
    /* deleted the code here for readability */
    WHERE ((f.slug IS NOT NULL) AND (t.slug IS NOT NULL));
```

  The values here are being pulled from the table `lowcal_sessions.allow_list_answers` or `analytics_logs.allow_list_answers`

  > [!IMPORTANT] At the end of your SQL script after the view creation/replacement, it is important to add another line which ensures the new variable is read by Metabase


  We currently have two views, so you should add these two lines to the end of the migration file, one for each view:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON "public"."analytics_summary" TO metabase_read_only;
GRANT SELECT ON "public"."submission_services_summary" TO metabase_read_only;
```


  ðŸŽŠðŸŽ‰ðŸŽˆ Now your new variable is ready for testing ðŸŽˆðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ

### Step 3 - Testing your new `ALLOW_LIST` variable

  Now you can begin testing your a service where your new passport variable is set, and as it is populated in the passport, it should come through to your new view.column. 

  Key to ensure that it is coming through in the right format, and with the expected value. A typical issue may be that it comes through as something like `['your value']` which will be read as `jsonb` by metabase and only allow boolean based filtering when creating dashboards, *does it exist or not*

  You will need to alter your SQL script for creating the new view to fix this
